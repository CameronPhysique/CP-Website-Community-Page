     <p> How We Started This Blog
Want to create something meaningful? Why not start a blog? Why not become a blogger? Creating this blog is one of the best decisions Ryan and I ever made. After all, our blog is how we earn a living. More important, it’s how we add value to other people’s lives.<br><br>
       
        <img class="blog-image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Haz_bvWmR_YU1pdgE0R0Vu3cmg_Ki2bOPU4RU7U6HkKUVAFxt-9g-IevGVgWpI_vzJDYG1_2zb_VGBCFn2AAeJU6945diocbexpiSq7QXlalVIqrl7c7TeNsLLXsn7cXtrk15VdMVA=w1920-h1080" width="30%" height=" auto" alt="" />

So you’re thinking about starting a blog, but you don’t have any idea where to start, right? Guess what—neither did we! Before we became “The Minimalists,” we wanted to start a blog to communicate our thoughts and express our feelings, but we were overwhelmed with options.<br><br>

Clueless, confused, and confounded with choices, we had no idea how to start a blog or how to be a blogger. When should we start? How do we register a domain name? What is hosting? Which blogging platform should we use? How do we choose a blog theme? What is a plugin? What should we write about? Heck, we could hardly spell HTML, let alone build a blog!
<br><br>
But good news: it turns out that starting a blog is much easier than you think. We’ve learned a ton of lessons during our ascent to millions of readers, and now you can learn from our pain and suffering to avoid much of the tedium involved in setting up a blog.
